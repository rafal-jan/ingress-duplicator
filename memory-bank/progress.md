# Progress

## Completed
- ✅ Project initialization
  - Go module initialized
  - Kubebuilder scaffolding set up
  - AppIngress API and controller stubs created
  - Initial CRD and RBAC manifests generated
- ✅ AppIngress CRD implementation
  - Defined IngressTemplate with metadata and spec fields
  - Added targetNamespace field with validation
  - Added status conditions field
  - Added custom printer columns
  - Generated CRD manifests using `make manifests`
- ✅ Controller implementation
  - Implemented reconciliation logic for AppIngress
  - Added namespace validation
  - Added Ingress creation/update with owner references
  - Implemented status conditions (NamespaceValid, IngressCreated)
  - Added RBAC rules for required resources
  - Implemented finalizer-based cleanup for cross-namespace resources

## In Progress
- None at current stage

## Known Issues
- Cross-namespace owner references not supported (by design)

## Next Tasks
1. Add validation webhooks for target namespace (optional)
2. Document usage examples

## Test Results
- ✅ Local cluster testing completed
  - AppIngress creation successful
  - Cross-namespace Ingress creation works
  - Status conditions update correctly
  - Namespace validation functions as expected
  - Automatic cleanup of Ingress resources on deletion

- ✅ Controller tests implemented
  - Unit tests with envtest framework
  - Test coverage at 67.9%
  - Tests verify:
    * Ingress creation in existing namespace
    * Error handling for non-existent namespace
    * Ingress updates with template changes
    * Status condition updates
    * Resource cleanup with finalizers
    * Ingress cleanup on AppIngress deletion
    * Edge case handling for deletion scenarios (e.g., already deleted Ingress)
